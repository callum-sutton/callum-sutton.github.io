    <p> I'm a fourth year maths student at the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/">Australian National University</a> in Canberra. This is my <a href="/cv/callum_sutton_CV.pdf">CV</a>. </p>

## Honours Thesis
This is my Honours thesis, [Differential algebraic geometry and the Geometric Mordell Conjecture][my_thesis], written under the supervision of [Dr. James Borger][jim]. 

## Writing
Here are some expository writings which I produced during my time as an undergraduate: 

* [The algebraic K-theory of finite fields][K-theory] (June 2020).
* [C*-algebras and the Gelfand--Naimark Theorem][C-star] (November 2019).
* [Coxeter groups and CAT(0)-complexes][Coxeter] (May 2019).
